# Project Introduction

  We create a aural browser engine. Basically, it takes the HTML and CSS and generates audio based on that. Rather than focusing on the visual component of what the inputs may hint at, we will try to have the inputs refer to audio, and have our site output different noises depending on the input.

# System Overview
